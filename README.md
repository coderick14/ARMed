#### Build instructions
##### Build from source
Requires Go to be [installed](https://golang.org/doc/install) and [configured](https://golang.org/doc/install#testing)
```
go get github.com/coderick14/ARMed
```

##### Download the compiled binary
Just download the binary for your required OS and architecture from [releases](https://github.com/coderick14/ARMed/releases)

#### Usage
`ARMed --help` will show all the usage details
```
ARMed version 1.0
Author : https://github.com/coderick14

ARMed is a very basic emulator of the ARM instruction set written in Golang
USAGE : ARMed [OPTIONS]... SOURCE_FILE

--all 		show all register values after an instruction, with updated ones in color
--end 		show updated registers only once, at the end of the program. Overrides --all
--no-log 	suppress logs of statements being executed
--help 		display help

##### NOTE : On Windows, if your cmd does not support unicode characters, pipe your output to a file.
```
ARMed.exe myfile > output.txt
```
Then view the file in your favourite editor (Notepad++, Wordpad, Sublime Text etc)
